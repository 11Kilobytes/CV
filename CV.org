I am interested in theoretical ecology, particularly ecological
modelling and its integration and interaction with field experiments and
data. My main interest lies in the field of processes and pattern
description and analysis which processes cause pattern and how pattern
influence the processes. These pattern and processes can range from
population to ecosystem levels.

Essential is for me the close integration of theoretical models and
field work and field data. Models can help to plan experiments,
determine sample sizes needed, simplifying experiments. Field
experiments can enhance and simplify models and validate results
obtained in ecosystem models. These simplified but valid models can be
used to address conservation related questions.

More specifically, I am interested in the functioning of ecosystems and
the dynamics of populations and communities which processes and
disturbances are essential in maintaining the dynamics? How do they
react to changes in e.g. the frequency or intensity of these processes?
Which processes and disturbances are essential in maintaining certain
pattern in the system? Which role does dispersal play in the maintenance
of these systems?

To answer these questions, it is important to combine field work with
ecological simulation models of different complexity in all stages of
the project from the planning of the experiments to the analysis of the
field data and the identification of important parameter and processes.

My PhD focused on the role of seed dispersal in restoration and
biological invasion, the effects of alien vegetation on the
establishment of indigenous species and the effects of biocontrol agents
on the spread of invasive species. This involved developing rule-based
simulation models reflecting the seed dispersal and plant distributions
observed in the field, and making predictions of the spread of species
under different scenarios. The model was written in Delphi.

A recent research focus was on population dynamics and reconstructing
the age structure of populations of /Aloe pillansii/, spatial dynamics
of alien invasive plants and the interaction with different management
strategies, including biocontrol. My latest projects (spatial and
temporal dynamics) combine the field of ecological modelling with
spatial statistics, as the development of simulation models as well as
the comparison of different spatial pattern is essential to them.

To link management into the models developed to be able to provide
applicable feedback to managers, is an important aspect for me, as well
as the close co-operation with managers during all phases of the
project. This approach, coupled with a close co-operation with field
biologists, makes it possible, that the results of the projects are not
only scientifically interesting, but also have an impact on the
management practises.

In the field of statistics, I am interested in resampling methods and I
employed a bootstrapping approach in the analysis of seed dispersal
data. Data arising from the simulations are all analysed in the
statistical package R, using a range of different functions and modules.
I have written numerous scripts in R to aid with data analysis and
presentation. I also wrote a package for R implementing the Earth Movers
Distance based on an implementation in C++ by Haibin Ling and Kazunori
Okada.

All my simulation models and analysis use only Open Source software.
This includes Linux as the operating system of choice, R for analysis
and writing my simulations, GRASS and QGIS as GIS programs, which I also
use in my simulations (GRASS). This approach of only using Open Source
software, provides the flexibility to develop the simulation models and
analysis protocols, distribute them freely and to enable others
(scientists as well as implementing agencies like nature conservation
agencies) to use the code without limitations and without having to
purchased specific software.

*Laboratoire Ecologie, Systematique et Evolution, Paris Sud*

Adapt the framework developed to simulate the alien spread in the
Western Cape for management of invasive alien species in the
Drakensberg in Southern Africa. This included adding of new species
and modification of processes parameter. The final product was a
framework for further development.

** 2008 -- 2012
*DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology, Stellenbosch University*

Investigating the temporal dynamics and the spread of biocontrol
agents and their host plants on a landscape scale using a GIS based
ecological simulation model, as well a non-spatial approach to
understand diverse aspects of the interaction between biocontrol agent
and host plant and how these interactions influence the effectiveness
of biocontrol agents in halting the spread of invasive
species. Results from the project were used to inform implementing
agencies and are communicated in the form of contributions to a
handbook.

Modelling the spread of alien species in the Western Cape with the aim
of optimising the alien management strategies. This project included
aspects ranging from using an Analytical Hierarchical Process to capture
and quantify the subjective decision making process of prioritizing,
translating this into a spatial simulation model, developing a
spatial-temporal simulation model which included fire, alien plant
management, different dispersal vectors (wind, water, birds) and to use
high performance computing infrastructure (cluster) to run the
simulations and to develop a package for R to compare the different
resulting prioritisation maps spatially.

Investigating the spread of invasive species under different climate
change scenarios. This involved developing the spread models (population
based as well as probabilistic) which included climatic suitability maps
to project the observed distribution under different climate change
scenarios to identify risk areas and to assess the invasive potential of
these species.

Assessing the viability of pine plantations under different (and
changing) fire regimes using a basic modelling approach.

focus on the recruitment events and their reconstruction.

*Conservation Ecology and Entomology department, Stellenbosch University*

Modelling the role of seed dispersal in restoration and biological
invasion, and investigating factors influencing the spread of a species.
I have developed rule-based simulation models based on data collected in
the field and experts estimates to predict the rate of spread of a
species depending on dispersal ability, competition experienced in
establishment, and the effects of biocontrol agents.

Buffalo using microsatellites

absence data was used to identify areas most relevant for conservation.

Environmental Education Centre. It included, among others,
questionnaires to tourists and schools concerning their willingness of
paying to visit the centre.

** 1995 -- 1995
*Department of Physics, Philipps-Universität Marburg*
Developed simulation model focussing on the effect of habitat use on the
mean survival time of populations. This research was conducted in
co-operation with a biologist who was involved in the planning of the
project and in the formulation of the questions. Building a simulation
model of the population investigated provided important insights in the
importance of different habitat types for the survival and conservation
of the species.

From 1997 -- 2007, I taught the module "Introduction to True Basic", a
one-week introductory course to the ecological modelling module as part
of the MSc Conservation Biology at the University of Cape Town. For the
same course, I assisted in lecturing the module "Ecological Modelling"
for three years.

In 2004, I taught a seven week course including assignments on models
in ecology as part of the BWE 424 course in the Department of
Conservation Ecology, as well as additional lectures on models in
ecology, and I regularly assisted in teaching Leslie Matrix modelling
in a module on sustainable harvesting.

In addition, I taught six practicals for the Population and
Conservation Ecology undergraduate course at the Stellenbosch
University.

During my PhD I co-supervised an MSc student who investigated seed
dispersal in Renosterveld by conducting seed trapping experiments. 

In 2007, 2008 and 2009 I taught R introductory R block courses to
students from postgraduate to postdoctoral level (between 2 and 3 days
each).

In 2008 and 2009 I was involved in conducting the Tygerberg Olympiad,
a project for grade nine to eleven learners, in which they are taught
aspects ranging from ecological, legal, archeological aspects
concerning the region (Tygerberg). At the end, they are expected to
give a short presentation and prices are handed out.
