abstract = {Determining the geographical range of invasive species is an important component of formulating effective management strategies. In the absence of detailed distributional data, species distribution models can provide estimates of an invasion range and increase our understanding of the ecological processes acting at various spatial scales. We used two complementary approaches to evaluate the influence of historical and environmental factors in shaping the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a wide- spread, highly invasive species native to South America. Occurrence data were combined with environmental data at incremental spatial scales (extent and resolution) to predict the suitable range of the ant invasion using ecological niche models. In addition, we also used a spread model that simulated the jump dispersal of the species to identify the most plausible scenarios of arrival of L. humile in the NE Iberian Peninsula at local scales. Based on the results of both modelling practices, we suggest that L. humile might have reached its maximum geographic range at regional scales in the NE Iberian Peninsula. However, the species does not appear in equilibrium with the environment at small spatial scales, and further expansions are expected along coastal and inland localities of the Costa Brava. Long-distance jumps are ultimately responsible for the spread of the Argentine ant in the area. Overall, our study shows the utility of combining niche based models with spread models to understand the dynamics of species' invasions.},

abstract = {Invasive species alter the functioning of natural ecosystems, creating
“novel ecosystems” comprising species occurring in combinations with
no analogs within a given biome. This poses major challenges for
managers who cannot rely exclusively on previous experiences. Multiple
factors that drive invasion and which interact in complex ways demand
innovative management approaches. We show the utility of scenario
planning in considering options for management in a region with substantial
problems with invasive alien plants: South Africa's Cape Floristic
Region. The approach allows us to identify the driving forces that
shape the status and trajectories of major woody invasive plants
and to identify sensible strategies by considering a set of scenarios
based on the main uncertainties that encapsulate the linkages between
the various components of the management of biological invasions.
Attitudes of landowners and management capacity are shown to be the
crucial uncertainties influencing the spread of major invasive species;
axes based on these factors define our scenarios. Mapping current
management projects onto scenario axes highlighted key differences
among areas. These insights can assist in directing particular management
units toward more desirable futures. Our study highlights the need
to link social, political and legal constraints with ecological processes
to assure the effectiveness of management operations in controlling
biological invasions.},

abstract = {Invasive alien plants play an important role in our changing world and have a considerable negative impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world. One effective control strategy involves the use of biocontrol agents which either damage the invasive alien plant itself or reduce the production of seeds. In this paper, we focus on seed-attacking biocontrol agents. To be able to predict the impact of biocontrol agents on the seed production pattern provides a way of comparing the impact of different biocontrol agents before they have actually been released. This becomes complex in systems where more than one biocontrol agent is present and where both depend on the same resource. In this paper, we examine a system consisting of two seed-attacking biocontrol agents (a midge and a weevil) and one invasive alien plant (Acacia cyclops). We used a non-spatial but temporal model to predict the impact of these biocontrol agents on flowering and seed set. We used a global sensitivity analysis (i.e. analysing the impact of several parameter simultaneously) to evaluate the impact of selected parameters which were considered uncertain but important. We could show that the system, even without biocontrol agents, fluctuates for most parameter sets between years, and that the fluctuations increased after the release of the biocontrol agents, although the number of seeds produced was, on average, substantially smaller. We found that the two biocontrol agents could usually not coexist, highlighting that special care needs to taken in selecting each additional biocontrol agent to avoid driving an already established biocontrol agent to extinction. These observations make a strong case for long-term monitoring after the release of biocontrol agent.},

abstract = {Invasive alien trees and shrubs pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services in South African fynbos ecosystems. An ambitious initiative, the Working for Water program, commenced in 1995 to reduce the extent and impact of plant invasions. Despite substantial progress, the problem remains immense, and innovative ways of improving the efficiency of control operations are urgently needed. This study sought to develop a robust conceptual framework for effective management of the most important invasive alien plant (IAP) species. Two methods were applied in exploring the complexity of problems, thereby identifying appropriate response strategies. The DPSIR (Driving forces-Pressure- State-Impacts-Responses) framework and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool were used to design a strategy for prioritizing management actions. This strategy considers explicitly the most influential fac- tors that determine the distribution, abundance, spread and impacts of IAPs. Efficient management of IAPs is constrained by multiple interacting environmental and socio-economic factors. Factors related to the fire-prone nature of the ecosystem and the characteristics of the invasive stands emerged as pivotal features for setting spatially-explicit priorities for management. Results of the analyses provide an objec- tive and quantifiable perspective for improving the management efficiency. We conclude that consider- able progress in controlling the spread of IAPs in fynbos ecosystems could be achieved by better coordination of management practices and by improving the quality of species distribution data.},

abstract = {Clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is a necessary but expensive exercise. Typically, insufficient resources are available to clear all areas simultaneously. Consequently areas need to be prioritized for clearing. The financial resources available determine the extent of the area which can be cleared, while the prioritization identifies the location of the areas to be cleared. We investigate the following questions: (1) How does a change in the budget impact on the efficiency of the clearing operations over time? (2) How does this differ for different sites? (3) Can we identify pattern which make it possible for managers to determine if their budget is sufficient to achieve a management goal (e.g. clearing 95{\%} of the area of IAPs) in a given time? (4) Can we draw general rules about how the time needed of achieving a management goal is changing when increasing the budget? We use a spatio-temporal explicit simulation model (SpreadSim) to simulate the spread of major woody IAPs over time, using a random prioritization strategy as a null model. This strategy requires no understanding or assumptions about the factors influencing spread; it is thus a reasonable baseline prioritization strategy. Our results confirm that a reduction of the budget increases the time needed to reach a management goal of 95{\%} non-invaded areas and simultaneously increases the overall budget needed to achieve this goal. In addition, for each site, we can identify three values. Firstly, a “lower critical limit” of the budget, below which the IAP spread is only slowed down and management does not result in a reduction of the area invaded by IAPs, which is independent of the management goal. Secondly, the “critical budget”, at which we have a chance of more than 50{\%} of achieving our management goal in a given time. Thirdly, an “upper critical limit” for the budget, above which no substantial change in the time needed to reach the management goal can be observed. For all our three sites, the “upper critical limit” is located at approximately 1.7 times the “critical budget”. The variability of the temporal trajectories of the area covered by IAPs for different simulations for the same input parameter and highly non-linear change in IAP cover over time indicate that an identification of the “critical budget” based on few years of IAP management is nearly impossible and that the use of simulation models is imperative. Nevertheless, the general pattern observed can be generalized to other prioritization strategies and provide important guidance for budget allocations.},

abstract = {Aim Decision-support models have considerable potential for guiding management strategies when problems are complex. The robustness of such decision-making processes is rarely evaluated, and the influence of decision criteria (or factors) in management decisions is seldom considered. We present a framework for a spatially-explicit sensitivity analysis by using a scheme developed to provide objective guidelines, in the form of static priority maps, for managing woody invasive alien plants (IAPs). Location The Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Methods The model included seven factors related to management history, fire risk, and the age, identity, density and spread of IAPs. Each factor had a weight associated that reflected its relative importance in prioritizing areas for clearing. We changed these factor weights using three approaches of sensitivity analysis and assessed the effect of these changes on the spatial structure of the resulting priority maps in three different management regions. Results Different outcomes arose depending on the importance given to different factors. Priority maps were most sensitive to the fire-related factors, suggesting that fire is both a crucial driver of invasion in fynbos and an overriding determinant of management options. The factor ‘area burnt recently' provided crucial information for the effective clearing of IAPs. The sensitivity of the model to changes in other factors was more context specific: levels of sensitivity were highly dependent on different features of the landscape, especially the spatial heterogeneity of particular factors. Main conclusions By clarifying the importance of factors in shaping priority maps, the sensitivity analysis framework enabled us to identify the necessary factors to produce outcomes matching a pre-selected management strategy. This is important for cost-efficient management, as acquisition and curation of data is expensive. This spatially-explicit sensitivity analysis is, thus, recommended to evaluate the robustness and generality of selected management strategies, and validate the assumptions derived from decision-making protocols.},

abstract = {We present a simple method for assessing the medium-term sustainability of different flower harvesting intensities (i.e. percentage of number of stems harvested per individual) for two re-seeders and re-sprouters of fynbos plants on the Agulhas Plain in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. We interpret our results from an ecological point of view, looking at impacts of harvesting on vegetative re-growth and survival of frequently harvested fynbos species, and an economic point of view, determining the cumulative number of stems harvested per year. We analysed the impact of different harvesting intensities on two obligate re-seeding (Erica corifolia (L.) and Erica imbricata (L.)) and two strongly re-sprouting species (Brunia laevis (Thunb.) and Staavia radiata (L. Dahl)) on different flower farms. Seventy-five randomly selected plants of each species were experimentally harvested in the same way as is done by flower harvesters. Fifteen plants of each species were left as controls (un-harvested) and 15 each were harvested (cut 15–20cm below the inflorescence) such that 25{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%} of the inflorescences were removed. Harvested stems were labelled and the number of new shoots counted. Additionally we recorded plant height and mortality. 100{\%} harvesting resulted in high mortality rates for both re-seeders (for both species 100{\%} of the individuals were dead at the end of the experiment) and resprouters (for one species all 15 individuals were dead at the end of the experiment and for the other species 4 of 15). Re-seeders in particular were highly susceptible to harvesting below the first branching node, which generally also resulted in plant death. Both guilds can survive up to 75{\%} harvesting (resprouters experienced no mortality for one species, while in the other 4 out of 15 died; of the re-seeders, 9 out of 15 died in the one species, while only 1 out of 15 in the other) and are still able to grow in height. For both seeders and resprouters we recommend that flower harvesters do not harvest in young veld. To ensure sufficient seed set and to avoid seed bank depletion we recommend to preferably only harvest between 25 and 50{\%} of stems per individual.},

abstract = {In 2010, the parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 with the mission of halting biodiversity loss and enhance the benefits it provides to people. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets (Aichi Targets), which are included in the Strategic Plan, are organized under five Strategic Goals, and provide coherent guidance on how to achieve it. Halfway through the Strategic Plan, it is time to prioritize actions in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for the Aichi Targets in 2020. Actions to achieve one target may influence other targets (downstream interactions); in turn a target may be influenced by actions taken to attain other targets (upstream interactions). We explore the interactions among targets and the time-lags between implemented measures and desired outcomes to develop a framework that can reduce the overall burden associated with the implementation of the Strategic Plan. We identified the targets addressing the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss and the targets aimed at enhancing the implementation of the Strategic Plan as having the highest level of downstream interactions. Targets aimed at improving the status of biodiversity and safeguarding ecosystems followed by targets aimed at reducing the direct pressures on biodiversity and enhancing the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services, were identified as having the highest levels of upstream interactions. Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of the Strategic Plan is the need to balance actions for its long-term sustainability with the need for urgent actions to halt biodiversity loss. Im Jahre 2010 fasste die Biodiversit{\"{a}}ts-Konvention einen Beschluss zum Schutz der Biodiversit{\"{a}}t f{\"{u}}r die Dekade 2011–2020. Das prim{\"{a}}re Ziel dieses Strategischen Plans ist es, den Verlust von Biodiversit{\"{a}}t zu reduzieren, sowie ihre enorme Bedeutung f{\"{u}}r die Menschen zu veranschaulichen. In diesen Strategischen Plan sind die “20 Aichi – Ziele” integriert, die in f{\"{u}}nf Kernziele kategorisiert sind und als Leitfaden zur Realisierung der Aichi-Ziele dienen. Im Rahmen des Strategieplans ist es an der Zeit die Ma{\ss}nahmen zu priorisieren, welche maximale Erfolge zum Erreichen der “20 Aichi–Ziele” bis 2020 versprechen. Dabei muss betrachtet werden, dass bestimmte Ma{\ss}nahmen zur Zielf{\"{u}}hrung m{\"{o}}glicherweise andere Ziele beeinflussen (s.g. abw{\"{a}}rts gerichtete Interaktionen=“downstream interactions”); im Gegensatz dazu k{\"{o}}nnen Ziele wiederum die Ma{\ss}nahmen beeinflussen (s.g. aufw{\"{a}}rts gerichtete Interaktionen=“upstream interactions”). Wir untersuchten die Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Kernzielen und den Zeitintervallen, zwischen den durchgef{\"{u}}hrten Ma{\ss}nahmen und dem Eintreten der gew{\"{u}}nschten Ergebnisse. Diese Untersuchungen sind notwendig, um die wichtigsten Ma{\ss}nahmen mit den h{\"{o}}chsten Effekten innerhalb aller Ziele zu identifizieren. Dabei identifizierten wir Ziele, welche sich prim{\"{a}}r mit den Ursachen des R{\"{u}}ckgangs biologischer Vielfalt besch{\"{a}}ftigen und Ziele, in deren Fokus die Verfolgung des Strategischen Plans steht, als hochgradig abw{\"{a}}rts gerichtete Interaktionen. Ziele, die sich vornehmlich mit der Sicherung von {\"{O}}kosystemen zur Verbesserung der biologischen Vielfalt besch{\"{a}}ftigen, gefolgt von denen, deren Schwerpunkt auf der Reduktion von direkten Belastungen auf biologische Vielfalt liegt, und jene, die aufzeigen, welchen Mehrwert biologische Vielfalt und {\"{O}}kosystemleistungen f{\"{u}}r alle bieten, weisen die h{\"{o}}chsten aufw{\"{a}}rts gerichteten Interaktionen auf. Einer der schwierigsten Aspekte bei der Umsetzung des strategischen Plans ist die Notwendigkeit einer Balance zwischen Ma{\ss}nahmen zur Umsetzung einer langfristigen Nachhaltigkeit und der Umsetzung von notwendigen kurzfristigen Sofortma{\ss}nahmen zu finden, welche den Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt aufhalten.},
