@inproceedings{Krug2009a,
abstract = {Background and goal of study Managing invasive alien plants (IAPs) is usually a triage, constrained by human and financial resources. Limited resources do not allow for the complete eradication of all IAPs in the whole managed area. It is thus essential to use an objective and transparent prioritisation ap - proach. However, even the most objective and transparent prioritisation does not guarantee effectiveness, and success, measured in time required until an IAP is eradicated or decimated to a given level, can only be assessed over time. Materials and methods To be able to compare the effectiveness of different prioritisation strategies and to select the most effective one, we developed a spatio- temporal simulation model (SpreadSim) to simulate the spread of IAPs over time. Simulations were run over 100 years, during which one prioritisation strategy was used, and the amount of the area cleared was constrained by financial resources. SpreadSim incorporates spatial as well as non-spatial information, includes fire spread simulation, the spread of the IAPs and costs of clearing. Results and discussion We will show that the prioritisation and optimisation are highly dependent on the underlying landscapes, but that certain generalisations can be drawn for both. Implications and data requirements for the usage of this methodology in management will be discussed.},
